RALEIGH BELAIR DOUBLE COUPON NATIONAL INTRODUCTION 
If it is decided to nationally launch the RALEIGH / BELAIR Double 
Coupon program , it in anticipated that a incremental $ 3 , 750 , 000 will 
be spent in a three month period . Three million in advertising covers 
use of Sunday Supplements , outdoor , and newspaper in above average 
sales areas for the brands . Seven hundred and fifty thousand is 
allocated to sales promotion to fund a second major brand promotion 
for RALEIGH BELAIR . ( Each brand was allocated only une major brand 
promotion during 1976 ) . 
An additional $ 3,000,000 is currently being considered on top of the $ 3 , 750 , 000 . 
Consumer research indicates low competitive smoker awareness of the 
Double Coupon pregram . in the test markets . It is believed that this additional 
money may be needed to achieve a substantial level of competitive smoker 
awareneas to generato trial among non RALEIGI / BELAIR SIrokers .

In the pyrolysis of cellulose , more than 40 compounds were observed on the gas chrona 
tograms . Sixteen these products have been identified , and 7 of them were major 
products . The preliminary result showed that the yield of these products depends . 
on the temperature and the duration of pyrolysis . Some of these products increased 04238597 
with the increase of temperature which others increased first and then decreased when 
the temperature went up further . The yield of many major products also increased 
as the duration of pyrolysis increased , however , a decrease of yields was observed 
when the pyrolysis time was prolonged .

Chris Nelson called me this morning with a question about the draft Informed Consent for the TES Multi - Center study 
from Informed Covance Consent . Essentially . Given the , he time is questioning and input already why we put are into considering the IC format to use used a new with ( Covance's the MDS ) studios format , for he the is trying to 
understand our rationale for introducing another IC format . 
I wasn't sure whether this was based on the IC used in the TES pilot study , nor was I entirely clear on the rationale 
( does each CRO have their own IC format ? ) , so I told him I would talk to you and got back with him as soon as 
possible . 
He will review the Covanco IC as is , if that is what we want , but I think he ultimately raises the question from the 
standpoint of consistency . Please let me know your thoughts / rationale so that I can get back to him .

IN RESPONSE TO YOUR INQUIRY ABOUT ADVERTISING EXPERTT'S 
INTERACTION WITH THE LA METRO GROUP AND ITS PUBLISHER , MR . HAMM , 
THE FOLLOWING OUTLINES EVENTS LEADING UP TO MR . HAMM'S LETTER TO 
MR . CAMPBELL LAST MONTH ( CORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT DATED ) : 
BACKGROUND- 
IN MAY , 1990 ADVERTISING EXPERTI BECAME OUR AGENCY OF RECORD FOR 
AFRICAN - AMERICAN ADVERTISING . MR . HAMM'S PUBLICATIONS , ALONG 
WITH ALL OTHER PUBLICATIONS ON OUR SCHEDULE WERE REVIEWED BY 
THE AGENCY . 
ADVERTISING EXPERTI REQUESTED BACK ISSUES OF THE LA METRO 
GROUP'S NEWSPAPERS BOTH IN WRITING AND VERBALLY . THE REQUEST 
WAS MET WITH RESISTANCE AND WAS NEVER FULFILLED . AS A RESULT OF 
THE NEWSPAPER'S NON - COMPLIANCE , THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE PM 
USA LIST . 
ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS CONTINUED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE LA 
METRO GROUP AND ASSURED THE PUBLISHER THAT THEY WOULD BE 
CONSIDERED FOR ADVERTISING AS SOON AS ISSUES ARE FORWARDED ON A 
REGULAR BASIS . 
ADVERTISING EXPERTI'S RECOMMENDATION -- 
THE AGENCY RECOMMENDS THAT PM USA REFRAIN FROM ADVERTISING 
WITH THE LA METRO GROUP . THE PUBLICATION APPEARS TO BE UNSTABLE 
AS A RESULT INCONSISTANT PUBLISHING PRACTICES , E.G. ONLY WHEN THE 
NEWSPAPER OBTAINS FINANCIAL BACKING IN THE WAY OF ADVERTISING . 
ADDITIONALLY , ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
MR . HAMM'S QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS BACKGROUND . 
NEXT STEPS -- 
GARRISON JACKSON WILL ATTEND THE NNPA CONVENTION IN MINNEAPOLIS 
NEXT WEEK AND IS PREPARED TO DISCUSS PM USA BUSINESS 
REQUIREMENTS WITH MR . HAMM ( IF MR . HAMM IS IN ATTENDANCE ) . 
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION .

As you know there was a problem with the 1800 - to - VWear phone number being assigned to

If the caller mentions V - wear or Vision Value , they will be transferred by APAC to Sitel to be 
handled by a V - wear CSR . If the call is an Accommodation call , they will handle by APAC 
as they normally do . 
After our conversation this moming I am confident that Mark has sufficient staffing to handle

COMMENT 
The dog was on the PHO study in Enviro Control and was a high nicotine smoker . He 
had smoked 399 cigarettes in a period of 34 days . The findings in the case were those 
of thrombi in both auricular appendages of the heart with multiple emboli in six of 
the seven lobes . As a result of these emboli , recent infarcts developed within the lung . 
As is common in the presence of infarction , hronchiopneumonia is a comp ! tention . 
It has been our experience that dogs who smoke a high nicotine cigarette develop 
pulmonary infarction . The origin of the emboli is in the thrombi within the auricular 
appendage . Thrombosis in the heart occurs infrequently in low nicotine cigarette 
smoking dogs . It is interesting that this dog as well as Dog 6025 and other P 
smokers show similar changes . The presence of the pneumonia is a complication of 
the pulmonary infarction .

Replace the existing headbox and inlet manifold on Line I and Line II . 
PROJECT JUSTIFICATIONSPRING PREDIENESTS 
Current operating plans are for Line II to operate at 450 feet per minute in 1996. This will require replacement of the 
existing headbox , fan pumps and associated piping . Line I headbox is 19 years old . This headbox is constructed of carbon 
steel with a stainless steel clad liner . The carbon steel is rusting resulting in warping of the headbox bottom . This 
warping is causing sheet streaks and basis weight variations and therefore variations of RL sheet . The Line II headbox 
will be moved to Line I.

RE : BRAND FAMILILY IN - DEPTHS ... 
BackgouND 
The OVERALL OBTECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO Assess How BEST TO SEGMENT THC 
CIGARETTE MARKET , AS AU INITIAL STEP , IT WAS FELT THAT AN IMPROVEMENT 
WAS NECESSARY IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BRAND FAMILIES . Thus , A SERIES 
OF IN - DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE . 
FINDINGS 
IT HAS BECOME APPARENT TO ME THAT CONSUMERS TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFITS 
OF CIGARETTES IN ROUGHLY THREE WAYS : 
PRODUCT BENEFITS : low taR , RELAXING , SATISEVING 
USER BONGEITS : MASCuliNE , FEMININE , MACHO 
PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS : GETS WIFE OFF back , MAKES ME FOEL BETTER , MAKES 
PAMA MG A PART OF THE GROUP , 
no 
EVERY CIGARETTE HAS SOME OF EACH OF The AbouG BENEFITS IT Is The 
PROPORTION OF This BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THE BRAND WHICH CHANGES . ATTACHED 
IS A MAP WHICH REPRESENTS MY HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE BENEFITS 
PROVIDED BY SOME MAJOR BRANDS . 
THE SHoerconiuG OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE 
BETWEEN BRANDS PROVIDING THE SAME TYPE OF BENEFIT WITH DIFFERENT 
IMAGES ( MARlbono & Virginia Slims ) . 
THE STRUCTURE OF THE MARKET VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN OIDER

Dear Bob : 
Several "" Untamed points "" campaign evolved . after the D : llas groups as relates to the 
First , the consumer needs a call - to - action . "" Come to Marlboro 
Country "" , "" Fly the Friendly Skles "" , "" Discover Menthol Refreshment "" 
are examples of a consumer call - to - action as we perceive it . 
The group members seemed to need help in making the transition 
from "" Untamed "" to the animal visual to a cigarette offering . 
This needs to be smoothed and made easy for the reader . 
Second , package visibility needs to be improved . Soveral comments 
were made with the basic thought being that the group member did not 
know he / she was looking at a cigarette ad . The relationship ( oize ) 
perceptions ) of the animal and the package needs to be improved . 
Third , benefit needs to be communicated directly and immediately . 
The campaigns that were best received had the consumer benefit of 
front . The weaker ones did not . 
Next Steps 
660105133 
Using "" Spirit "" as the working name , I would like to see additional 
approaches incorporating the above comments . For review purposes , 
I want these kept in tlosue form as you did before .

Apparently , there was some confusion resulting from this meeting 
because in the case of "" Pie "" , Bates provided a mechanical for 
30 - sheet but a layout with a type cell overlay for paint . In the future , 
it should provide the latter for both 30 - sheet and paint . 
As to the Call Report in question , therefore , the material provided

Would you please arrange to have the Call Report revised accordingly .

Dear Don : 
P 
Enclosed are our Design Proposals for your new pren : lum - priced and 
wine - flavored brande . I'm also enclosing copies of an article that 
appeared recently in a Japanese design publication , which you may not 
have seen . 
In reviewing the Proposals you will note that on the "" Cost Estimate "" 
pages we refer to design budgets that we have established with B & W. 
These were set up some time ago because , ander our Retainer agree 
ment , all of our charges to B & W are computer on the basis of time 
expended . Our design budgets cover design of all kinds of typical pack 
aging ( 10's , 20's , 200's , shipping cases , etc. ) as well as design of 
tippings and imprints . We have found through the years that our costs 
in some cases exceed these estimates , while in the majority of cases 
a solution is rapidly reached with the result that our design charge 
is below the budget . Our practice has been to advise B & W whenever 
we realize that it will be necessary to expend more time than the budget . 
allows , and cost estimates are adjusted accordingly . 
680085265 
You will also note that we have indicated time schedules for both projects , 
but I want you to know that these are not inflexible . We are accustomed

Dear Mark , 
This will provide you with the Agercy's point of view en RALEIGH Parent / 
Fantly advertising which we discussed informally last week . 
Conclusion 
We continue to believe that total Brand sales and share will be optimized 
by placing advertising dollars behind RALEIGH Lights exclusively . Parent 
or Fantly of Products advertising does not represent the test use of funds 
for RALEIGH at current budget levels . 
Rationale 
1. Ideally , we would advertise both RALEIGH Parent and RALEIGH Lights . 
de see a two fold role for Parent advertising , both primarily defensive . 
First of all Parent advertising should slow the rate of Parent decline by 
some extent current srokers full ' taste defection to low and , ' tars ' . Secondly by , Parent to 
advertising serves as an image umbrella which reinforces the product story 
for the Light style by continuing to provide Brand heritage . 
Five major , non - thol brands support then Parent styles Marlboro , Winstca , 
Canel , Kent and Benson & Hedoes . Of those only Marlboro has been able to 
hold losses Parent concerable losses to to or a minimum greater ( than -4 % ) RALEIGH's . The other , cespite brands PALTION's have had Parent leck 
of direct Parent advertising ( Exhible 1 ) . 
Regressive Marlboro , Kent support . Cesel of Lights and Benson style & has Hedges resulted . in ret share gains for

Many thanks for your letter dated 28th November , 1984 . 
results It before certainly deciding makes sense on a blend that we change await to the JPS product . test 
Having taken into account the urgency of the need as 
well as the comparative relevance of the two pieces of research 
for the Hong Kong market , we propose that we will make our 
decision with reference to the Hong Kong product research only .

Dear Harry : 
Thank you for the various items of information that you have sent me recently . 
I was sorry to miss you in Bloomington , but the M. D. P. in Chelwood was 
interesting , and the contacts will be beneficial to getting things done . 
I write to let you know that I am coming to Europe later this month . I will 
be accompanied by Joe Hough who is the ex - Liggetts man working for Bill 
Telling on KENT . On September 27 , we go with Mike Hamerton to Woking 
to discuss KENT in the UK . On the Friday , John Howley and I will be presenting 
to Mr. Sheehy on the new KENT advertising and improved packaging . 
We will be at BWIT's offices in Brussels on October 1 , at H. V. L. Luxembourg 
on October 2 and 3 , and visit BAT Suisse in Geneva October 4 and 5. The latter 
visit and development plan which will result from the discussions should be 
very interesting . KENT is unsuccessful in Switzerland at the moment . 
I am glad Claude Borloz has taken over the marketing responsibility as I 
respect him . I don't know March , the Research Manager , and have mixed 
reports about him . I haven't been to Geneva for about four years but with 
Mr. Macadam visiting the company during the same week , mine will be a 
flying visit . 
Germany is the subject of a letter John Howley is writing to you . Depending 
on Phil Wright's findings and John Howley's own trip in late October , I may 
well need to visit Hamburg with you ( or invite the Germans to Millbank or 
Louisville ) in late Autumn and work with them to implement decisions on the 
KENT family made at a higher level than mine . As you are BWIT's local contact 
point with BAT Germany , perhaps you would let me know what you think once 
we all know what they are proposing .

Dear Mr. Dixon : 
According to wire service reports and as printed in the Buffalo Evening 
News May 9 , 1967 , a brief on behalf of the American , Brown & Williamson , 
Ligget : & Myers , Philip Morris , and R. J. Reynolds tobacco companies was 
submitted by the Tobacco Institute to the Federal Trade Commission . This 
submission was made the occasion for a false and libelous press release 
attacking the scientific article "" Tar and Nicotine Retrieval from Fifty - six 
Brands of Cigarettes "" which appeared in Cancer in March 1967. There is 
nothing in the Tobacco Institute's report to suggest that the so - called tobacco 
company "" critique "" contained any new factual information or raised any 
questions that had not already been answered in the text of the scientific 
article ( as will be shown below ) . This report of the tobacco industry may 
further confuse and mislead the public concerning the health hazards of 
cigarettes and hamper and delay public health efforts to educate the public 
concerning these hazards . 
We would like to call your attention to the following points in our 
scientific article on tar and nicotine in cigarettes : on page 329 in the sec 
tion "" Meaning of yield per puff "" it is pointed out that "" the general distribution 
of the data is essentially the same regardless of which way the yield is ex 
pressed "" and the few exceptions to this statement are cited and discussed . 
There are no grounds for the criticism in the Tobacco Industry briof that 
"" tar and nicotine of test cigarettes should have been measured on a per - puff 
basis as well as for total weight . "" They wore . 
A standard scientific procedure ( confidence intervals ) was used in all 
yield graphs to indicate the "" margins of error . "" Such procedures auto 
matically overlapping take of the sample intervals size into would account prevent ( if the the assertion samples are of differences too small the be 
tween brands ) . Sources of error are discussed on pages 330 and 331 in

SUBJECT : POTENTIAL PROCESS MODIFICATIONS / 599 
In order to assist us in the development of new products , we need to 
obtain an estimate of the impact that various process modifications 
I may have on the Macon plant . New process and product technology is 
developing in several areas including the use of a CTO process , imple 
mentation of additives to tobacco , development of a longer lasting 
cigarette , new blends and materials which are more brand specific , 
etc. These projects span the entire range from new product develop 
ments to needed improvements on current brands . Our needs in these 
areas are obviously immediate from an overall Corporate viewpoint . 
However , we also recognize the realities of the impacts changes to our 
process and materials will have in manufacturing . 
What we need then is an ability to rationalize these objectives and 
short - term constraints . In order to accomplish this rationalization , 
we will need your input from the viewpoint of the degree of difficulty 
of implementation . 
More specifically , we need estimates for each of our considered modi 
fications addressing items such as cost , timing , degree difficulty , 
resource needs , etc. We can then utilize this data to both guide our 
development efforts as well as reconcile any differences in time 
frames and priorities . 
526002068 
A list of some of the modifications we are currently considering is 
attached . Relative to the information we need , we are not looking for 
"" to - the - penny "" estimates . A quicker response is more important than a 
fine - tuned estimate . At the same time , recognize that our programs 
will be impacted and a degree of accuracy is essential .

SUBJECT : Promotion Response 
This responds to your note of 7/23 requesting a review of our promotion 
response report . I will be addressing only those specific offers for KOOL 
and KOOL Super Lights where there are significant differences at projected 
redemption versus actual redemption . 
44 
On KOOL Parent , there are only two offers in this category as follows : 
1. KOOL Country carton offer projected response 10 % new projection 
14 % this offer was extremely high value with the free carton . I 
feel that it will come in at 14 % ; the problem is that we had no ex 
perience in setting our projection . 
Free hat offer as a tape - on worked extremely well . As a mall 
back it is too early to comment yet because mail - in cards only 
used after tape - ons are depleted and only 50 % of P - O - S has been 
used to date because 7 shows are still to come ; will follow up with 
data after all 15 shows completed . 
KOOL Super Lights Offer 
A. 14P 
1 . The national offer on KSI . ( 504/3 packs and 50 ¢ / 1 pack ) has been 
revised based on recent data so that actual redemptions are coming 
in very close to projections . 
2 . All remaining offers refer to regional or local tests : 660066987 
a . 50c / 2 packs delivered with sample estimated at 18 % 
versus 10 % budget this offer was first considered a 
real problem because of litter with flyer passed out 
with packs , now looks to be very efficient vis - a - vis 
conversion should be considered for future sampling .

SUBJECT VICEROY RICH LIGHTS PORTFOLIO TEST RESULTS 
After reviewing the results of the above test , we basically agree 
with the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report . 
However , we are not in total agreement with the conclusion / rocom 
mendation made regarding the use of "" VICEROY "" in the headline of 
the Pack on silver Executions , We feel that the issuo was not 
definitively resolved in this test and should be looked at further . 
while it is true that two of the three executions 
containing "" VICEROY "" in the headline did not score 
consistently as well as a similar ad without "" VICEROY "" 
in the headline , Split Cory ( which did contain VICEROY 
in the headline ) did emerge as one of the better overall 
scoring executions , producing a strong positive image . 
of VICEROY Rich Lights . It can be assumed that this 
executien scored vell because of splitting the copy , 
rather than being a function of having VICEROY in the 
headline and splitting the copy . However , to defin 
itively resolve this issue , a split copy execution 
without the name "" VICEROY "" in the headline should 
also have boon tested . 
Since the use ( or nen - uce ) of the "" VICEROY "" name in 
VICEROY Rich Lights advertising is such a key issue , 
we recommend that the issue be resolved definitively 
by testing split copy with and without the "" VICRROY "" 
name in the headline .

SUBJECT DROWN & WILLIAMSON Futer Tips 
REFER TO J. Mosher to . Shaw - 2/1/74 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Joe , your referenced letter lists quite a number of requirements for this 
component of the filter tip that B & W has asked you to supply , but it is still 
vague enough that I am providing you with several quite different structures 
herewith , hoping that if I can get some reaction to ench of these , I sholl 
then more nearly be in a position to hit the target in the center . 
One of the points of confusion is that as the first requirement you indicate 
that the material should have a yield of 1031 to 2031. inf . ( 1.e. 22.50 / R 
to 451/1 ) , but then indicate that a sample of co / it araft x 2 / R poly was 
satisfactory except for the fact that the bleached kraft absorbs oll and water . 
That particular Irminate checks out at 1 / R or 6 , 20. in . / ib . 
One of the immediately available samples which we are enclosing herewith 
i EXP - 10433-1 , which is 408 white opsque glassiex 125 PP . That also 
comes to CEFIR and has the low yield of the previously tested sample just 
mentioned . We should point out that glassine will not wick oil , but it w 
pick up moisture to a certain extent . If it should prove satisfactory in every 
way except yield , something quite similar could be produced from 250 / 
white opaque glassine x 100 PL ( white ) . 
A second candidate attached is EXP - 226-11 which consists of 50 gauge polyester 
x white ink x priawr x 250 Pt . This candidate is a little thicker in gauge 
than would apparently be desired , but could be considered as exemplifying 
a type of structure employing a polyester face ply for sitteras and a poly 
ethylene ply for best seal . Instead of trapping a white tek the polyethylene 
ply could be while pigmented , or if we went to a 1 mil polyester , as in a 
structure such as icopit x 100PE , both plies could be white pigmented , One 
exemplification of this approach is a third sample structure , NP - 10071-15 , 
which is 50P x adhesive x 200 C - 77 . Oce , se recognize that the C - 79 
ply is appreciably thicker than desired , but if this material sild be there 
satisfactory we could reduce the C - 12 ply to zmits wah certainty zal possibly 
to 1-1 / 2 mile . 
The two remaining samples are merely unsated white pigmented films , 
2 mils C - 79 in une case and 2 mil Corvire 1165 in the other .

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
Washington , D.C. 20580 
OFFICE OF INFORMATION 393-6800 Ext . 197 
For RELEASE : IMMEDIATE , Thursday , May 22 , 1969 
KUTENGENATUS A 
ADVERTISING File No. 692 3254 
The Federal Trade Commission today announced its determination to issue a com 
plaint under its consent order procedure charging violations of law by The American 
Tobacco Co. , 245 Park Ave. , New York City . 
( HOT -- A complaint is issued whenever the Commission has found "" reason to believe "" 
that the law has been violated and that a proceeding is in the public interest . The 
issuance of a complaint does not indicate or reflect any adjudication of the matters 
charged ) . 
The FIC's complaint says that , "" Respondent is now , and for some time lust past . 
has been , engaged in the advertising , sale and distribution of cigarettes including 
brands designated ' Pall Mall Gold ' 100's , ' Pall Mall Menthol ' 100's , and ' Lucky 
Filters ' . *** 
"" In the course and conduct of its aforesaid business , and for the purpose of 
inducing the purchase of its cigarettes , the respondent has made , and is now making 
numerous statements and representations in advertising including , but not limited to , 
ndvertisements broadcast on radio and television and inserted in magazines , newspapers 
and other advertising nedin with respect to the tar content of suid cigarettes . "" *** 
The complaint alleges that , by the use of these statements and by "" failing to 
disclose facts which are material in the light of these statements and which consumers 
need to make an informed judgment , respondent has represented and created the 
impression that its cigarettes are lcx in tar when in truth and in fact its Pall Mall 
Gold 100's and Lucky Filters contain approximately 20 and 21 milligrams of tar , 
omounts which rank them 56th and 77th higher among the 122 brands tested than the 
brend containing the lowest tar level of 4 milligrams . "" 
The complaint charges that , "" By representing its cigarettes as being low in tar 
when in feet they contain five times the amount of tar found in the lowest yielding 
brand tested and rank above the midpoint on a tar - yield spectrum running from a low of 
milligrams to a high of 36 milligrans , respondent has engaged in and practiced 670310871 
falsehood and deception . "" 
Comissioner HacIntyre abstained from this action , stating as follows : 
"" Here the chellenged advertising is to the effect that the respondent's 
product is "" lower in tur thon ever before "" and "" lover in ter than the best 
selling filter king . "" I an informed that this advertising is literally true . 
Therefore , it would appear that respondent.has effected a lowering of tur con 
tent in its product . Heretofore members of the Federal Trade Conmission have 
expressed the thought that tobacco manufacturers should endeavor to make , 
advertise and market safer cigarettes . If respondent has improved its cigarette ,. 
should he be barred from advertising that fact ? That is one question involved 
here to which I do not have an answer . Without an answer to that question I 
feel that I should have abstained as I did from participating in the action of 
the Comission to which I have referred . "" 
The respondent has been given the opportunity to advise the Commission whether 
or not it is interested in having the proceeding disposed of by the entry of a 
consent order .

PRESENTATION TO NATIONAL COMMISSION ON SHOKING AND PUBLIC POLICY 
AMERCIAN CANCER SOCIETY , INC . 
March 22 , 1977 
The City of Manteca is a fairly typical California city located in the San 
Joaquin Vailey approximately 50 miles south of Sacramento along Interstate 
Route 99. The City with its population of approximately 13,000 in 1977 is 
unique ( 38 ) percent only to of the this disproportunate total is under number the age of of young 18 years people . . The Thirty median - eight age 
of a Mantecan is 23 years concrasted to 46 years for our sister City of 
Tracy ten miles to the West . The City of Manteca's social - ethnic composition 
is best illustrated by its 97 percent white classification and its median 
income which was in the 1970 census the second highest in the County . The 
City is served by four elementary schools and two high schools . 
The smoking issue in Manteca was first brought to light by a request of the 
high school administrative officials to the School Board asking for 
permission to designate an on - campus smoking location . School officials 
cited the irritation to the entire student body caused by the amount of 
smoke collected in the high school rest roons . 
The Parent Teachers Association responded with opposition to the designation 
of an on - campus smoking area . Through the efforts of the Parent - Teachers 
Association and in particularly the leadership of Mrs. Marilyn Asher and 
Mrs. area Kenneth and in turn Bedsaal asked , the support Board from of Education the community declined at large to designate to join such in the an 
control of this ever increasing problem of young people and cigarettes . 
The interest City quickly and that realized if any progress the smoking could problem be made to to be curtail of a community the use - wide of 
cigarettes , effort must be expended by parents , school district officials 
and the local government . 
The causes of secking have been obvicus to sociologists and teachers for 
many years . The emotional pressure cormonly identified as peer pressure 
and the normal desire to attain adult status were recognized as the cause 
Sehind this syndrome . By pure observation in and around the vicinity of the 
elementary schools , it was apparent that more 8 to 12 year old students are 
acquiring this dangerous habit every year . 
Through the past afforts of the American Cancer Society , the carcinogenic efforts 
from cigarette smoke is well understood by most American adults ; but a brief 
reminder that in 1959 approximately 325.000 people died from cancer ord 
other gruesone statistics brought the City Council to a position that action 
should be taken in the interes : of the health and public welfare . 
in an initial effort the P.T.A. called attention to the California Penal Code . 670313383 
Section 308 which states that "" every person , firm or corporation which sells . 
or gives or in any way furnishes to another person who is in fact under the 
age of eighteen years any tobacco , cigarette or cigarette paper or any other 
preparation of tobacco is guilty of a misdemeanor . "" The Parent - Teachers 
Association asked for local enforcement to attempt to discourage over - the 
counter sales of cigarettes to minors . This was attempted through an 
enforcement effort by the Manteca Police Department Crime Prevention Unit 
which distributed posters to all retail outlets quoting the California Penal 
Code and a warning to the merchants . After an initial period of several

BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION 
JUNE 29 , 1979 
SUBJECT : Brown & Williamson's Compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's 
Subpoena to Produce 15 Years ' Worth of Marketing Material 
For the past 3 years Brown & Williamson has been saddled with the 
exceedingly burdensome demands of a Federal Government subpoena issued 
by the Federal Trade Commission to all of the major tobacco companies , 
their advertising agencies and trade associations . The FTC has asked for 
copies of our file documents dating back to 1964 which relate to consumer 
attitudes toward smoking and other advertising and marketing material . 
We have made numerous inquiries to the FTC as to why it needs these 
documents , and have received several answers , each about as clear as the 
wording of the subpoena itself . ( As an illustration , the subpoena contains a 
single sentence made up of 131 words and 44 punctuation marks to define 
the word "" document . "" ) An FTC attorney told the press in January , 1979 that 
"" the regulatory agency has no specific goals in mind "" and "" the FTC can issue 
680110791 
a subpoena just to satisfy its official curiosity . ""

INTRODUCTION 
"" We appreciate very much this opportunity to appear 
before you today to discuss the tobacco / health controversy . 
While the tobacco / health issue is obviously an all 
important one to us , we realize that it is only one of many 
others with which you are concerned . We are not here today to 
. 
quote prove endquote that cigarettes do not cause lung cancer 
or that cigarettes are quote good endquote for you . 
Our purpose in secking this audience is simply to 
expose information to you of which you may not be aware and 
that we believe has a significant bearing on the controversy . 
The facts and statements which we will give you today 
are presented by us in the belief that there are many controver 
sial questions concerning smoking and health and that these ques 
tions must ultimately be answered by further scientific research 
and new knowledge -- and that full , free , and informed public dis 
cussion is essential in the public interest . 
This field as you know is a complex one and one in which 
a vast amount of scientific research has been performed . Although 
there are many other sources of information which we could have 
used and which we can supply , in selecting the material for our 
presentation today we have confined ourselves to those sources

SLIDE NO . 1 A subject of considerable interest . 
All Ban Cigarette on Advertising today is the potential of a ban on 
all cigarette advertising . 
SLIDE NO . 2 While we believe this is a remote 
Packs and Cartons possibility , we would quickly move . 
to a plan which placed our advertis 
ing message onto our packs and 
cartons , and investigate potential 
in all other areas : Premiums 
including lighters , clothing , etc. 
much like the European experience . 
SLIDE NO . 3 The second possible scenario would 
Eliminate Image call for the elimination of image 
advertising for cigarettes . In the 
case of Carlton this would not pose 
a problem , but on our other brands 
it would demand changes in our 
advertising executions . 
SLIDE NO . 4 The third possible scenario would 
Eliminate Tax Deduction call for the elimination of the tax 
deductibility for advertising 
expenses . This would increase our 
cost of doing business , but we are

November was another excellent month , with sales up 15.4 % , gross 
profit up 40.92 and operating income up 26.28 . 
Advertising and selling costs increased sharply , due to new 
LUCKY STRIKE Filters Filters 
For the year - to - date , operating income is now up $ 48,268,000 or 17.7 % . 
On December 16 , we announced another price increase , effective the 
end of the year . This increase was 70 ¢ per thousand . 
The industry will start 1983 with selling prices ( on 100's and 
PALL MALL Red ) 35 % higher than the start of 1982. 73.588 in the equivalest 
of $ 2.00 per thoud on 144 per comes on 18174 per part 
na Witbehalf . 
of the 35 % increase , 19 % is the - pe thousand excise tax increase . 
It is impossible to say just what the effect of these increases will be 
on consumer sales . The impact has hopefully been minimized by the fact 
that the increases have come in several steps . 
Even short - term sales are difficult to project , due to abnormal trade 
purchases at year - end .

TESTIMONY OF PROFESSOR JOHN y . EANZIAP 711 , EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL OF 
ACTION ON CROSSING AND HEALTH , BEFORE THE FEDERAL TRADE COBISSION , OCTOMER 11 , 1977 
The technique of calling for xore research and study as a means of 
delaying needed regulations often called "" studying the problen to death "" is vell 
known in the Nation's capitol . It is serious enough when used as a tactic by the industry 
seeking to continue its illegal conduct , and resisted with varying degrees of success by 
the agency charged with protecting the public . But it is disastrous and also inexcusable 
when the very agency charged by Congress with protecting the public interest by enacting 
and enforcing the regulations itself continues to duck the desuo either by the shan of 
celling for Congressional action , or by the more insidious technique of insisting that 
additional studies are needed before any effective action can be taken . 
Based upon the Commission's failure to take any effective action during the 
past several years , and information obtained both from within and without the Commission , 
Action on Smoking and Health believes and fears that the so - called "" Fichbein Keport "" , 
which comprises over 90 % of the Y.T.C.'s report to Congress ( not including tables of tar 
and nicotine content ) , is nothing but a transparent gimmick to justify ito past inaction 
and to a provide a basis for failing to take action now and in the foreseeable future .. 
Keedless to say , ASH opposes any such delay founded on the apurious and misleading argument 
that more research is needed before any effective action can be taken . In this testimony 
wo vill indicate why we are led to this view of the Fishbein report , and uhy even the 
Fichbein report itself supports hard - hitting regulatory action now without more needless 
delay . We will also respectfully indicate how in our view the .T.C . has managed to tie 
its own hands by subscribing to certain clearly erronious beliefs as to its function and 
its method of operation . Finally , to make this point perfectly clear and to avoid any 
further excuses that delay for further research is unavoidable , we will outline several 
actions which the F.7.C. can and should take now , without more delay , and for which 
no additional research is necessary .

presentation,"Three Years After the Surgeon General's Reporte 
Daniel Hora By , Ph.D. 
As I look at the topic assigned to a today , "" We have atopped 
smoking , why haven't cut patients , "" I wonder , since I have no patiente , 
if this makes an inpatient man . Perhaps it does . There are timer 
when I become very impatient at the slow pace of our crapaign against 
the hazards of cigarette smoking . 
On the eve of the third anniversary of the Report to the Surgeon 
General on Smoking and Health we read in the market reports that 
cigarette consumption is on the rise . Nearly half of the adult population 
are now cigarette smokers and some 1,500,000 teenagers join the renke 
overy year . An estimated 300,000 of these adult cookers will die 
preesturaly this year ; millions more will suffor one or more chronic 
conditions ; untold numbers will be sick enough to stay home from work - 
all because of cigaretto smoking . 
This is far from a pleasant picture for an anniversary celebration . 
However , it could be much worce . He have made progress in a significant 
vay . 
Let's go back in history for a moment and look at that has actually 
been happening to smoking in this country . After the close of World 
Har II , when servicemen returned hons and cigarettes vero no longer in 
short supply , yearly consumption started to climb . Presumably this 
upward trend would have continued except for four important events . The 
first was the initial reports , three in this country and one in England , 
i 
linking the use of tobacco to the increasing incidence of lung cancer .

( AMI RUBIN ) 
EPIDEMIOLOGIC ASSOCIATIONS HAVE IMPLICATED TOBACCO 
SHOKING AS A RISK FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS RESPIRATORY 
AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES . SOME OF THESE STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED 
A DOSE - DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CERTAIN DISEASES AND THE 
DURATION AND NUMBER OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED , AS WELL AS WITH 
INDICATORS OF THE AMOUNT AND DEPTH OF SMOKE INHALATION . FOR SOME 
PEOPLE , THE PHARMACOLOGIC BASIS OF SMOKING SEEMS TO BE DEPENDENT 
ON THE NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE SMOKER . THE QUESTION OF WHETHER 
OR NOT NICOTINE METABOLITES ARE ADDICTING , HOWEVER , IS STILL 
DE BATABLE . MOREOVER , SEVERAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT 
THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE IN HEALTH HAZARDS TO HEAVY SMOKERS WHO 
SWITCH FROM CIGARETTES CONTAINING HIGH TAR AND NICOTINE LEVELS 
TO CIGARETTES OF LOW TAR AND NICOTINE CONTENT . THIS POTENTIAL 
INCREASED HEALTH HAZARD COULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY CHANGES IN 
SMOKING HABITS AND ALTERATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S SMOKING PROFILE . 
To QUANTIFY INDIVIDUAL SMOKING BEHAVIOR WHILE VARYING THE NICOTINE 
CONTENT OF TOBACCO , WE APPLIED UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS A

In 1990 Mr. John also developed a new technique for treating cancer ( which he had patented ) , called 
ISCHEMIA - REPERFUSION TUMOR THERAPY . Intial trials in Sweden have proven highly successful .

Carcinogenesis Assay of Subfractions of 
Cigarette Smoke Condensate Prepared by 
Solvent - Solvent Separation of the Neutral 
Fraction ¹2

Park Memorial Institute , New York State Department of

SUMMARY - Carcinogenesis assay was conducted on subfractions of the 
neutral fraction ( NF ) of cigarette smoke condensate , subfractions that were 
prepored by solvent partition . Of the 2 major subfractions , the "" methanol 
insoluble "" neutrals ( MIN ) were much more active than the "" methanol 
soluble "" neutrals ( MSN ) . Distribution of MSN between nitromethane and 
carbon disulfide yielded active fractions . Poor dose - response effects 
suggest that extraneous materials may reduce the activity of MSN . Analysis 
of the recovery of MSN is difficult , but apparently there were significant 
losses during separation . On countercurrent distribution ( CCD ) , MIN 
yielded 3 active and 2 inactive subfractions . Recovery of the activity of 
MIN in the subfractions was excellent in comparison with an earlier separa 
-tion with silicic acid chromatography . Recoveries might be improved if 
CCD is applied to the NF before the more rigorous chromatographic separa 
tions . J Notl Cancer Inst 49 : 477-483 , 1972 . 
IS AN earlier study , 4 of the subfractions prepared fractionating NF , with the hope that these losses 
by silicic acid chromatography of the neutral frac could be avoided .

were produced by each condensate . Smoke condensate from the English 
cigarettes was significantly more carcinogenic than that from American 
cigarettes when equal amounts of tor were applied to the skin . The data 
show with the that cigarette the carcinogenic composition potency , the method of smoke of from manufacture popular , or cigarettes or b both varies Not

"" Sudden unexpected death in wonen . Biologic and psychological origins . "" 
( American Journal of Epidemiology 114 / S : 671-82 , November 1981 ) 
"" The relationship of the risk of sudden death from arteriosclerotic 
heart disease to biologic and psychosocial factors was studied retrospectively 
in Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , in 80 white women who died from arterio 
sclerotic heart disease during March , 1977 - October , 1978 , and in 80 age 
matched neighborhood controls . All cases of sudden death in white women 
aged 25-64 years who died outside the hospital within 24 hours of onset of 
symptoms were ascertained . The overall autopsy rate was 63 % . Detailed 
post - norten examinations were conducted on 42 of 80 sudden cardiac cases . 
Cases were more often heavy smokers and had fewer children than the control 
population . Fifteen out of 80 women who died suddenly of heart disease 
and three controls had a definite history of psychiatric disease . Cases 
had more often experienced the death of a significant other within six 1002640770 
months prior to their denise . Multiple regression analysis showed that 
cigarette smoking , psychiatric history and death of a significant other 
contributed significantly to differences between wonen who died suddenly 
and control women . Thirteen women died suddenly under the age of 45 years . 
Six of the 13 deaths were due to arteriosclerotic heart disease . These 
six women were all smokers , and four were currently taking oral contra 
ceptives or estrogen replacements ....

SUMMARY 
A rapid and reproducible method is described for the analysis of the major 
tobacco docosanol artanol , palmitic lipids , squalene , including acid , , stearic a the - tocopherol C₁ acid - C₁4 , the , paraffinic unsaturated ß - amyrin hydrocarbons , C₁ cycloartenol , acids , cholesterol , neophytadiene , 24 - methylenecyclo , stigmasterol , phytol , , 
campesterol , sitosterol and solanesol . The method is based upon the short - column 
silicic acid chromatography of saponified lipids from a hexane extract of tobacco . 
titated of blend The the free , method conventional by lipids gas has chromatography are been separated flue demonstrated - cured into , tobaccos with non by - the polar the and use , highly polar two of internal close reproducible and - terpenoid grown standards tobaccos analyses fractions . The . of The applicability and a cigarette method quan 
should foodstuffs also . be applicable to analyses of lipids in other natural products , including 
INTRODUCTION 
Many of the components in the hexane - soluble fraction of tobacco , the so 
called tobacco lipids , and their pyrolysis products contribute to the flavor and aroma 
of tobacco smoke . Also , pyrolysis studies have shown that the hexane - soluble com 1003185971 
ponents in tobacco are major precursors of the tumorigenic polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke "" . Consequently , our laboratory has been involved 
in developing rapid and reproducible methods for the quantitation of the major 
lipid components in tobacco . Chortyk et al . developed a method utilizing silicic acid 
and gas chromatography ( GC ) for the determination of the paraffinic hydrocarbons 
and neophytadiene in leaf and smoke . Ellington et al.³ used ion - exchange chromato 
graphy and GC to analyze tobacco fatty acids of C₁ ; to C₁ , chain lengths . Schlotz

ABSTRACT 
The deposition and the internal distribution of total particulate matter ( T931 ) 
cigarett : smoke were examined under conditions of high T31 deposition in the 
lungs of mice . Two different smole exposure systems were used . The smoke 
cape which smoke is routed ( SEM through 21 ) the largecapacity amal containment ( 483 mice und ) dynamic is continuously system in 
nowg stram . Mice are restrained about the neck in starktyge bufers for 
nose only exposure . The Walton Horizontal Smoking Machine ( Walton ) is a 
ma capacity ( 12 to 20 mice ; static system where the smoke is introduced into 
espune chambers into which mice ( restrained in either stock type holders o 
whole body tubes ) impue deretly . Both machines were operated under 
andardized conditions for puff duration ( 2e ) , average paff volume ( 33 ml ) , 
puff Andeactive frequency ( once tracer per ( minute Clabeled ) , and dotraconcane butt length of ) egarette was used ( 23mm to quantcate ) . the 
deportion of 773 in tissons of the mouse after exposure to smoke When the 
Walton machine was used , the depouton of TPM for 2A1 Kentucky reference 
cigarettes increased with inceraung smole concentration and smoke - exposure 
time but was independent of sex or stran of mouse . Detectable levels of TM 
were found in the head , laryns , feep , and stomach . The catretion of TIM 
among these tissors did not change as the total exposure time increased to 300 
se or as the smoke concentration was increased to 14.1 % ( vel./vol . ) . Regardless 
of total exposure time or smole concentration , 13 to 77 % of the 7731 was found 
in the lungs and 88 to 915 of the TP31 was contained in the este respiratory 
tract . Thus the conditions of 10 % ( vol vol . ) smoke concentration for 300 ure of

A simple assay in described which is capable of detecting single breaks in purified 
radioactively labeled tropoelastin after incubation with diluce solutions of 
proteases . Using this assay we show that trepoelastin is rapidly cleaved by a 
variety of proteases , including leukocyte and pancreatic elastane , at physiologic 
pH and i wength . The results suggest the possibility that degradation of 
troporlase or other related biosynthetic intermediates may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of emphysema . 
The connective tissue protein elastin is largely responsible for main 
taining the elasticity of major blood vessels and lung tissue . In the highly 
insoluble elastin , the polypeptide chains are extensively cross - linked 
by desmosises and other cross - linkages ( 1.2 ) derived from the enzymatic 
oxidation of lysine residues ( 3-5 ) . A single polypeptide . designated tropo 
elastin , with a molecular weight of about 70.000 appears to be a soluble 
intermediate in the biosynthesis of the fiber ( 6-10 ) , although recent evi 
dence suggests that a larger molecular weight precursor may also exist 
( 11 ) . Recent studies have focused on the possible role of elastolytic en . 
zymes , particularly leukocyte elastase , in the pathogenesis of chronic ob 
structive lung disease ( emphysema ) . In experimental model systems , the 
major emphasis has been on the destruction of the mature clastic fiber 
by administered proteases , and in these systems there is a strong correla . 
tion between the production of emphysema and the cleavage of insoluble 
elastin ( 12-15 ) . However , in man the development of emphysema is a 
chronic . complex process often involving many years , during which time 
there may be periodic destruction and repair of pulmonary tissue . Such 
considerations suggest that interruption of elastin biosynthesis by degrada 
tion of tropcelastin could play a significant role in emphysema de 
velopment . 
As a first step in exploring this possibility , we have developed a simple 
assay which is capable of detecting a single break in the tropoelastin 
polypeptide chain and have examined the sensitivity of tropoclastin to a

Summary 
Using H - dioxane , the distribution of dioxane among a num . 
ber of tissues and various subcellular fractions of rat liver was 
studied . At various times after 1. p . injection , dioxane was found 
to distribute more or less uniformly among various tissues ( liver , 
kidney . spleen , lung , colon and skeletal muscle ) , consistent with 
its polar / nonpolar nature . Studies of the nature of dioxane bind 
ing , however , revealed that the extent of "" covalent "" binding ( as 
measured by incorporation into lipid - free , acid - insoluble tissue 
residues ) was significantly higher in the liver ( the main carcino 
genesis target tissue ) , spleen and colon than that in other tissues . 
Investigations of the subcellular distribution in liver indicated that 
most of the radioactivity was in the cytosol , followed by the micro 
somal , mitochondrial and nuclear fractione . The binding of dlox 
ane to the macromolecules in the cytosol was mainly noncovalent . 
The percent covalent binding was highest in the nuclear fraction , 
followed by mitochondrial and microsomal fractions and the whole 
homogenate . Pretreatment of rats with inducers of microsomal 
mixed - function oxidasee bad no significant effect on the covalent 
binding of dioxane to the various subcellular fractions of the liver .

THE STATE TOBACCO MONOPOLY , TRIPOLI , LIBYA 
SUMMARY 
A moderate concentration of bacteria was present on the tobacco 
after the original assay , but the number had dininished considerably 
upon a second microbiological assay one year later . Three bacteria , all 
Cram - positive rods , were isolated . 
FERMENTATION PROCESS 
The fermentation was carried out in wooden sided silos . The weight 
of the tobacco was approximately 2,000 kilograms . This particular fermen 
tation lasted for 22 days having an entry temperature of 30 ° c , a maxica 
temperature of 55 ° c , and an exit temperature of 40 ° c . The aroma of the 
fermentation was judged to be "" sweet for the type "" .

scientific_report,"AMMONIA DEVERMINATION 
When cigarette smoke is drawn through a Cambridge filter very 
little ammonia or ammonium salts are detected . Possibly the ammonia 
in the first puff comes through the filter . After the first puff the 
increasing deposit of acids on the filter combines with the ammonia 
and removes it from the gas stream . When no Cambridge filter is used , 
95 % free ammonia and ammonium salts are collected in 80 ml of .018 N H₂SO4 . 
Since the concentration of ammonia in cigarette smoke is quite low 
compared to the amount of acetic , formic and other acids present , we do 
not feel that the 40-70 ug./cig . represents free ammonia . 
Procedure - Two charcoal filter cigarettes are smoked for each determination . 
The smoke is dispersed through 80 ml of .018 N ESO , in a specially designed 
trap by means of a coarse fritted disc . The solution is added to a 100 ml 
1 
volumetric flask containing about 1.5 g . of permutit . The permutit has 
been screened and washed 3 times with 25 ml portions of water . The flask 
is shaken for 15 minutes on a Burrel wrist action shaker . If the desired 
agitation is not achieved , the flask is shaken by hand . The acid solution 
is poured off and the permutit is washed ' 3 times with 25 ml portions of 
distilled water . Five ml of water and 1 ml of 10 % NaOH is added to the 
permutit . The flask is shaken again for 5 minutes . The addition of 60-70 
ml water is followed by 3 ml Nesslers reagent . The flask is filled to the 
mark with water , inverted many times for mixing , and allowed to stand 30 
minutes .

Blank - The blank is processed in the same manner as the sample ; except , of 
course , the .018 N H₂SO4 solution contains no dissolved smoke .

scientific_report,"DISCLOSURE 
This invention relates to an improved smoking product . and a method 
for its manufacture . 
The geometry of the burning cone of smoking products currently 
produced leads to a reducing atmosphere in which pyrolysis reactions 
produce undesirable ingredients . This effect is created by the 
restriction of the flow of air through or around the fused burning 
mass , thus reducing the amount of oxygen in the area behind the 
burning cone which prohibits combustion of certain gases . 
This invention offers a method of manufacturing a smoking product 
whose burning cone would not restrict the flow of air as much as a 
conventional smoking product . 
Smoking products that contain tobacco that has been snredded 
finer than that found in conventional smoking products produce smoke 
containing lower amounts of the undesirable ingredients . 
This effect is caused by the condensing and reburning of smoke 
on the increased surface area of the tobacco , thus more completely 
pyrolyzing the smoke to its more desirable ingredients . 
The improved smoking product , to be described , produces less 
undesirable ingredients by the increased air flow through its 
00480124 
burning cone , or by increasing the reburning of the condensed smoke , 
or both .

TERMINOLOGY : 
Raisin concentrate is the name given to the pure concen 
trated extract of raisins prepared by leaching the raisins with 
water . The leaching process is undertaken in several stages to 
produce raisin juice . The liquid is then processed in a vacuum 
pan , where the excess water is evaporated to obtain a desired 70 ° 
brix concentration or 70 % natural fruit soluble solids . 
SOURCES : 
The major area of production of raisins is California but 
Australia and certain areas of the Middle East are also producers . 
Fatty the Middle acid esters East to have reduce been the used drying for many time years of the in grapes Australia ( 1 ) . and 
This shorter drying time is caused by the interaction of esters 
in the dip with the waxy surface of the grapes to increase the 
rate raisins of water are sun loss dried during without drying the . use In of contrast a drying , most aid California , which 
results in a raisin with a blue - black color , darker than that of 
Australian raisins . 
Raisin concentrate is manufactured from two different types 
of raisins , Thompson seedless and Muscats . Each type of concen 
due trate to has the its amount own of distinctive tartaric acid flavor present differing ( 2 ) . chemically The range in of pl 
tartaric acid in the Thompson seedless concentrate is 1.3-2.08 
giving it a pH range of 3.0-3.5 . The Muscat concentrate has a 
concentration range of 0.7-0.98 tartaric acid with a pH of

From : 
INTRODUCTION Return : 
Banks , Desmarchelier and Elek ( 1 ) outline four main 
methods for the analysis of bromide in foodstuffs . 
A simple and faster distillation method is described 
in this paper . Its accuracy and reproducibility are 
compared with neutron activation , X - ray fluorescence 
and iodometric methods . 
2 . METHOD 
lg finely ground cured tobacco leaves is heated 
slowly ( 3 4h ) to 450 475 ° c and maintained at that 
temperature until it becomes a white ash , or preferably 
ashed overnight for 15 hours . The ash is transferred 
to a Harkham still with a brush through a small glass 
funnel and is washed down with 5 ml distilled water . 
A volume of 5 al oxidising mixture , containing 
400 ml 1,25 M aqueous chromium trioxide and 300 ml 
concentrated sulphuric acid , is added . Steam is 
admitted to the still where selective oxidation of 
bromide to bromine takes place and this is distilled 
into 25 ml of 10 % potassium iodide until 100 ml have 
been collected . The liberated iodine is titrated 
with 0,005N sodium thiosulphate using a 1 % starch 
solution as indicator and a 10 ml burette graduated 
in 0,02 ml .
